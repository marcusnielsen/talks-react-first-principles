# Input Mark 3

This version is the final WET (Write Everything Twice) version.

The `model` and `view` are composed together into a React component in the `index.js` file.

As long as you want to explore different options, stay with this version. When you feel like you want to generalise the boilerplate code, it's time to make your own utility/framework code.
